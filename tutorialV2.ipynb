Find more information on all the options in the [manual](http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/user-guide/mdp-options.html) or in the following [webinar](https://bioexcel.eu/webinar-a-walk-through-simulation-parameter-options-mdp-files-for-gromacs-2019-12-05/). There are a lot of parameters that can be set, here we ony set the elemental parametes and leave everything else as default. Let's have a look at the input file:"

    "EM reduced the largest fores by slightly moving and rotating atoms, but the system as a whole is by no means at its equilibrium state yet. Before we begin real dynamics, we must therefore equilibrate the solvent and ions around the protein. If we were to attempt unrestrained dynamics at this point, the system could collapse. When we used `gmx solvate`, water molecules were placed in semi-ordered fashion (look at the visualization after we filled the box with water) and ions were placed by replacing some of these waters. This semi-ordered configuration is not something that would be represented by the force field, so we need to let the molecules move a bit to enter into a such a configuration."

    "Remember that posre.itp file which `pdb2gmx` generated a long time ago? We're going to use it now. The purpose of posre.itp is to apply a position-restraining force on the heavy atoms in the protein (anything that is not a hydrogen). Movement is permitted, but only after overcoming a substantial energy penalty. The advantage of position restraints is that they allow us to relax our solvent and ions around our protein, without letting the protein move. The origin of the position restraints (the coordinates at which the restraint potential is zero) is provided via a coordinate file passed via the -r option of `grompp`."

This ensemble is also referred to as \"isothermal-isochoric\" or \"canonical.\" The timeframe for such a procedure is dependent upon the contents of the system. Typically, 100-200 ps should suffice, and we will conduct a 100-ps NVT equilibration for this exercise.

Another point, which we discussed in the previous section, is to let the solvent molecules move and orient themselves around the protein surface, potentially entering pockets or crevices.

    "In the previous step, NVT equilibration stabilized the temperature of the system. Prior to data collection, we must also stabilize the pressure (and thus also the density) of the system. Equilibration of pressure is conducted under an NPT ensemble, wherein the Number of particles, Pressure, and Temperature are held constant. The ensemble is also called the \"isothermal-isobaric\" ensemble, and most closely resembles experimental conditions.\n",

    "The .mdp file used for a 100-ps NPT equilibration can be found in the input file folder. It is not drastically different from the parameter file used for NVT equilibration, but note the addition of the pressure coupling section. We will use the [stochastic cell rescaling](https://manual.gromacs.org/current/reference-manual/algorithms/molecular-dynamics.html#stochastic-cell-rescaling) as barostat. The stochastic cell rescaling algorithm is a variant of the Berendsen algorithm that allows correct fluctuations to be sampled."

    "The pressure value fluctuates widely over the course of the 100-ps equilibration phase, but this behavior is not unexpected. The reference pressure was set to 1 bar, so is this outcome acceptable? Pressure is a quantity that fluctuates widely over the course of an MD simulation, as is clear from the large root-mean-square fluctuation (in the order of 100 bar), so statistically speaking, one cannot distinguish a difference between the obtained average and the target/reference value (1 bar). The important point is that the average pressure remains on the same order of magnutude as the target pressure.\n",

    "The average value is close to the experimental value of 1000 kg m-3 and the expected density of the TIP3P model of 1001 kg m-3. The parameters for the TIP3P water model closely replicate experimental values for water. However, since we also have a protein in the box we can expect the density to be a little bit higher than that of pure water, which is also what we see from our plot. The density values are very stable over time, indicating that the system is now well-equilibrated with respect to pressure and density."

    "Upon completion of the two equilibration phases, the system is now well-equilibrated at the desired temperature and pressure. We are now ready to release the position restraints of the protein atoms and launch our production MD simulation for data collection. The process is just like we have seen before, but we will now continue the simulation from the checkpoint file ouputted from the NPT run. We will now run a 1-ns MD simulation. In the mdp-file, we have added a section that controls the output frequency for data in the log file (.log), energy file (.edr), trajcotry file (.trr), and compressed trajectory file (.xtc). Writing data too frequently will lead to significantly longer run times and larger output files, while too infrequent writes will result in loss of detail in the final trajectories. It is thus a good idea to think about how much time resolution your planned analysis will require before launching the simulation."

      ".g96, .pdb and .tng. The file formats are detected from the file extension.\n",
      "The precision of the .xtc output is taken from the input file for .xtc, .gro\n",
      "and .pdb, and from the -ndec option for other input formats. The precision is\n",
      "always taken from -ndec, when this option is set. All other formats have fixed\n",

      "Option -sep can be used to write every frame to a separate .gro, .g96 or .pdb\n",

      "There are two options for fitting the trajectory to a reference either for\n",

The need for a short timestep constitutes a major challenge in MD simulations since the timescales of interest often are orders of magnitude longer, leading to a high computational cost of typical simulations. There are a few different algorithms in GROMACS that can allow for a longer timestep and thus \"faster simulations\", but beware that they always come with some trade-offs to the dynamics. \n",

Then, we specify which types of forces to calculate less frequently (on the second mts-level) through the `mts-level2-forces`. `mts-level2-forces` supports the following entries longrange-nonbonded, nonbonded, pair, dihedral, angle, pull and awh.
